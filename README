This is a little compiler written using Jack Crenshaw's tutorial in
Pascal. The code is basically identical to the tutorial, but I've
modified the assembly instructions to amd64 with linux calling
conventions.

I've used fpc to compile the compiler and nasm to assemble the
resulting assembly from the compiler and finally tcc to link the
object file, but gcc works too.
